## ABOUT

Apples-to-Apples inspired game. 
Four players will choose their characters. Each round will start with one rotating judge and three blind caption writers. After all players have submitted their captions, a random Newyorker cartoon will render and the judge will choose their favorite caption for that image. After each player has served as judge, the game ends and the winner will be declared.
